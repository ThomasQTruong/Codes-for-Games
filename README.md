          - buildRowLeft() - Makes the robot create a row to the left.
      - epearl.lua
        - Uses an in-game robot to create n amounts of enderpearl(s).
        - Usage: `./epearl [n]`
          - n = the amount of enderpearls to create.
      - machine_normal.lua
        - Uses an in-game robot to create n amounts of normal compact machine(s).
        - Usage: `./machine_normal [n]`
          - n = the amount of normal compact machines to create.
      - machine_wall.lua
        - Uses an in-game robot to create n amounts of compact machine wall(s).
        - Usage: `./machine_wall [n]`
          - n = the amount of compact machine wall(s) to create.
  - ProjectOzone2/
    - computercraft
      - [wget.lua](Minecraft/ProjectOzone2/computercraft/wget.lua)
        - The wget unix command (used to download other scripts).
        - Relies on startup.lua OR current working directory.
        - Usage: `wget <url> \[output]`
          - url = link to the file to download (i.e. raw GitHub file).
          - output = name of the output file (can leave blank to parse URL for name).
        - Creation:
          - Different methods:
            1. Read and use **StartingOut.md** (easiest).
            2. Manually Write
                - Create file with `edit /bin/wget`.
                - Copy code from wget.lua into wget.
            3. PasteBin
                - Upload to [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/).
                - Use command in-game on computer to download: `pastebin get <url> <filename>`.
                  - url = pastebin link.
                  - filename = name of the output file.
      - startup.lua
        - Runs when the computer starts up.
        - If needed: change `/disk/wget` to the directory you keep your wget file in.
        - Creation:
          - Use `edit /startup` to create a file in the home directory.
            - Copy code from startup.lua into startup.
          - Run the command `reboot` to restart the computer.
